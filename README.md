# This is the second project of ME5402, AY20/21

## The folder mainly contains two parts: code and report

### Question:
We chose to conbine question 1-1 and 1-4. In fact, our initial plan was to complete all the sub-topics in both sub-questions. However, the modeling import part of problem 1-1 encountered a problem, and it could not be solved in the end. So we focus on control and algorithms.

### Code:
We use MATLAB_R2020b.

'1. CAD model and importing' contains part of our work in modeling and import. Note that due to the limitation of Github, it does not contain all codes and models.
If one want to get the full code, please feel free to contact any of the authors.

'2. PID control' contains a simply algorithm of trajectory following with PID control.

'3. Constrained control' shows a method of constrained control by modeling the car base together with the manipulator.

'4. Simulink NN' builds a neural network with Matlab, which helps to modify parameters in the control algorithm. Noted that since time limited, the performance of this model is not very good(huge time delay and poor tracking precision). One can modify this part if interested.

### Report:
This report focuses on the derivation of algorithm application, stability analysis, and a little explanation of algorithm and structure.

All parts of report are organised based on knowledge basically in class slides and the original algorithm paper.

Thanks all the authors.
